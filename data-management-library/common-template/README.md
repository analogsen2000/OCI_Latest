# Common Content

## How to Use this template

- Copy the index.html and manifest.json from this common-template folder into your project folder.
- Change the js and css relative file paths to point to this common-template folder (eg. ./common-content/js/workshop.js).
- The index.html acts your home page, which will include your Lab and ReadMe.md markdown files.
- Edit the sample manifest.json file with the names and titles of your workshops, and the file names of your ".md" markdown files.

To test this locally, you can use any webserver you have already installed that supports markdown. If you have none, you can install [Atom Text Editor](https://atom.io/) and the [Atom Live Server plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server)
